**Movie Recommender System:**

The project is a semantic search-based movie recommender system. It utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques to understand and analyze movie plots. Users can search for movies based on keywords or phrases, and the system will return a list of semantically similar movies. The recommendations are generated using a vector search index in MongoDB, combined with text embeddings generated by OpenAI's Text Embedding API.

**Key Features:**

Semantic search for movies based on plot descriptions.
Integration with MongoDB for efficient storage and retrieval of movie data.
Utilizes OpenAI's Text Embedding API for generating embeddings of movie plots.
Fast and accurate recommendations based on semantic similarity.
Simple and intuitive user interface.

**Usage:**

Enter a search query for movies based on their plot summaries.
The system will return a list of semantically similar movies along with their plot summaries.
